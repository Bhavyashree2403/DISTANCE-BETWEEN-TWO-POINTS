# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import math module to use the built-in function for the calculation.
### Step 2: 
Assign the values in two lists.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the restult in the format that two values after the decimal point.
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:
```
#Distance between two points

import math
list1=[4,2]
list2=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt((list2[0]-list1[0])**2+(list2[1]-list1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```  

### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
Thus the output for calculating the distance between two points is successfull.
